## About The Project
DinoBot is a Python script for playing the Dinosaur Game (also known as the Chrome Dino). It has the option to control the game with your hand through a video capture device (already implemented), and the option to play it AFK using a bot.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pearsettings44/DinoBot
   ```
2. Install requirements
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the script (using -v or -b flag)
   ```sh
   python3 ./dinobot.py -v
   ```

## Usage
```sh
usage: dinobot.py [-h] [-b] [-v]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  -b, --bot    play using a bot
  -v, --video  play using video capture
```

## Examples
```py
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/gdrive', force_remount=False)
import os
!wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/L0garithmic/fastcolabcopy/main/fastcopy.py
import fastcopy
!python fastcopy.py /gdrive/Shareddrives/Source/. /gdrive/Shareddrives/Destination --thread 20 --size-limit 400mb
```
If you want to see copy execution time:
```mod
!pip install -q ipython-autotime
%load_ext autotime
```
Check out <a href="examples.md">examples.md</a> for some more examples.

## Best Practice
Colab has wildly varying transfer speeds, because of this, the best we can offer are suggestions:
- For large groups of medium/small files, 15-40 threads seems to work best.
- For 50+ files with significantly varying sizes, try 2 sequentially copies. `-t 15 -l 400` then `-t 2`
- For files that are 100MB+, it is best to use 2 threads. It is still faster then rsync.   
- Currently `--sync` breaks if rsync is ran after. If you are mirroring drives. Disable `--sync` and use the rsync's `--delete` function.
